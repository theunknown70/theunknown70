## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm an MLOps enthusiast with a drive to operationalize machine learning models effectively. My journey in tech has equipped me with a strong foundation in creating efficient CI/CD pipelines, automating ML workflows from data ingestion to deployment, ensuring model reproducibility, and deploying scalable solutions on cloud platforms. I thrive on tackling complex challenges at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and DevOps.

While my core focus is **MLOps**, I also possess foundational experience in **MERN stack web development** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), which gives me a broader perspective on full-stack application architecture and development lifecycles.

✨ **My Mission:** To empower organizations by productionizing AI/ML models with reliability, scalability, and efficiency.

## 🎯 What I Do: MLOps Focus

* **☁️ Cloud-Native ML Deployment:** Architecting and deploying ML models on cloud platforms like AWS (EKS, SageMaker, EC2, Lambda).
* **⚙️ CI/CD for ML:** Building automated pipelines for continuous integration, testing, delivery, and deployment of ML models (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
* **📦 Containerization & Orchestration:** Utilizing Docker for packaging applications and Kubernetes (K8s) for managing and scaling them.
* **📊 Experiment Tracking & Versioning:** Implementing robust experiment tracking with MLflow and version control for data & models with DVC.
* **📡 Monitoring & Observability:** Setting up monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana) to track model performance and system health in production.
* **📜 Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing cloud infrastructure using tools like AWS CloudFormation and `eksctl`.
* **🔁 Reproducibility & Automation:** Ensuring ML workflows are reproducible and automated from end to end.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring & Learning

I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning. Currently, I'm diving deeper into:
* Advanced Kubernetes deployments for ML (e.g., Kubeflow, Argo Workflows).
* Serverless MLOps architectures on AWS (Lambda, Step Functions, SageMaker Pipelines).
* Building more sophisticated model monitoring systems for drift detection and explainability.
* Reinforcement Learning applications in real-world scenarios.
